Add any svg to your website with the superpowers of the block editor. Out-of-the-box security and speed optimization!

== Description ==

This plugin provides a Svg Block to your block editor, this can be used with any svg icon or image (or even a html snippet). Some key features are provided like automatic markup sanitation, optimization (svgo), and small utility to change the color and the markup that will be very useful for you to create variations of your image.

This block has the same controls as the images, but actually the content is xml markup, and you can change it as you like! This allows thousands of possibilities... You will be able to use css animations or js scripts to animate it, change the inner text of the svg, create variations of the same svg.
However, this has the disadvantage that the svg will not be copied into the media library, so if you plan to use the same svg several times (buttons, icons, etc.) you are better off creating a reusable block

From a performance point of view, be aware that the image will not be included as an external resource, but will instead be within the markup of the page, thus making svg even faster than it already is.

== Svg are awesome because: ==

- ‚úåÔ∏è Are always super sharp!
- ü™∂ Incredibly lightweight and doesn't require any additional resize image (you only need one source for all screen sizes and resolutions)
- ‚ö° Increased page performance! Using inline SVGs saves can save dozens of requests and save server download bandwith.
- üéâ highly customisable and animatable! Embedded svgs are easy to be animated, just use css!

= Security =

Since this plugin doesn't enable uploads of svg images into media library could be considered safer than all the others that enable the upload.
As if that wasn't enough Svg's will be cleaned with DOM purify which indeed is a first class js purifier, those used in php try to mimic how it works.

Svg will be included within the pages as xml fragments, so they will not be processed by imagemagick and cannot be uploaded by anyone from website "side". Only those with permissions to use the editor will be allowed to 'upload' (or rather include) them.

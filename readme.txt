Unlock the magic of your website with the SVG block. Out-of-the-box security and turbocharged speed optimization!

== Description ==

Enhance your WordPress website with the power of SVG images using the Svg Block plugin. Easily add and manipulate SVG images with the block editor. This plugin provides an intuitive Svg Block that allows you to incorporate SVG icons, images, or HTML snippets effortlessly. Experience the convenience of automatic markup sanitation, optimization (svgo), and a range of useful utilities, such as color customization and markup modification for creating image variations.

The Svg Block offers the same controls as regular images, but with the flexibility of XML markup editing. Unleash your creativity with endless possibilities‚Äîanimate SVGs using CSS animations or JavaScript, modify inner text, and create unique variations of the same SVG. Unlike traditional image formats, SVGs always render sharply and are incredibly lightweight, eliminating the need for multiple resized images for different screen sizes and resolutions.

Boost your website's performance with inline SVGs, which drastically reduce page load time by minimizing server requests and conserving bandwidth. Enjoy seamless integration and customization options that embedded SVGs offer, making your website visually stunning.

== Svg are awesome because: ==

- ‚úåÔ∏è SVGs render sharply and are lightweight, improving page performance.
- ü¶Ñ Add any SVG icon, image, or HTML snippet effortlessly.

- ‚ö° Increased page performance! Using inline SVGs saves can save dozens of requests and save server download bandwidth.
- üéâ Easy animation with CSS and JavaScript.

= üîí Security =

The Svg Block plugin prioritizes security by not allowing uploads of SVG images into the media library, making it a safer option compared to other plugins that enable such uploads. SVGs used with this plugin are cleaned with DOMPurify, a robust JavaScript purifier, ensuring that only safe and validated SVGs are rendered. Unlike SVGs processed by external tools like ImageMagick, the SVGs included within your pages as XML fragments cannot be uploaded by unauthorized users from the website side. Only those with appropriate permissions to use the block editor can include SVGs.

Svg will be included within the pages as xml fragments, so they will not be processed by imagemagick and cannot be uploaded by anyone from website "side". Only those with permissions to use the editor will be allowed to 'upload' (or rather include) them.
